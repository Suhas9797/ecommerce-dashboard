📊 Ecommerce Dashboard

This project contains an interactive Ecommerce Dashboard built using Power BI. The dashboard provides valuable insights into sales, revenue, customer behavior, and product performance, making it easier to monitor business growth and make data-driven decisions.

1. Short Description:

The Ecommerce Dashboard is a data visualization and analytics project built using Power BI. The goal was to transform raw ecommerce data into meaningful insights that help businesses monitor performance, identify opportunities, and make data-driven decisions.

Using Kaggle datasets, I designed and developed a dashboard that highlights sales performance, customer behavior, product trends, and regional distribution.

2. Features:

📈 Sales Overview – Track total revenue, profit, and order trends.  

🛒 Product Analysis – Identify top-selling products and categories.

👥 Customer Insights – Understand customer demographics and purchase behavior.

🌍 Regional Performance – Visualize sales distribution across different locations.

📊 Interactive Filters – Slice and dice data by time, product, or region.
